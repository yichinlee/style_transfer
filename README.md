In this project, we applied tensorflow to do the style transfer on fashion dress. We selected ‘Iris van Herpen 
Dresses”-”Body Microscopic Images” pair to do the experiment.

Concept:
Despite the biomimicry of early neural networks, the performance of recent AI systems improves in leaps
and bounds as intelligent agents crushing human pros at various venues where epitomes of human intelligence 
are displayed. It’s no longer sensible to anthropomorphize AIs not only because how their biological counterparts 
are dwarfed abysmally in comparison but also the logic underpinning their developments are more and more apathetic 
toward the neural substrates of a human brain. Our project explores this disheartening alienation between these two 
forms of intelligence by spotlighting what could be interpreted as one of its historical precedents in the recent 
past - an overcompensating trickery between the human body and its enclosure courtesy of the works by Iris van Herpen.
